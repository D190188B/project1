# README for Snort Project

## Project Title: Hardening Web Server Against DDoS Attacks Using Snort IPS

### Overview
This project aims to protect a web server from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using Snort, an open-source Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS). Specifically, the project focuses on mitigating ICMP-based DDoS attacks by filtering and dropping malicious ICMP packets.

### Files Included
- `snort.conf`: The main configuration file for Snort.
- `local.rules`: Custom Snort rules for detecting and blocking specific types of traffic.
- `alert`: The file where Snort logs alerts.

### System Setup
1. **Virtual Machines**:
   - **Attacker VM**: Running Windows OS to simulate DDoS attacks.
   - **Snort VM**: Running Debian OS, configured to act as the protective barrier.

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - The Snort VM has two network interfaces: one for internal communication with the attacker VM and another for external network access.
   - IP forwarding and Network Address Translation (NAT) are enabled on the Snort VM to route traffic appropriately.
  
- ### Installation Steps
1. **Install Snort**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install snort

2. **Install Necessary Tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install wireshark iptables

3. **Configuration Files**:
`snort.conf`
The snort.conf file is the main configuration file for Snort. Key configurations include:
   - Network Variables: Define the network segments that Snort will monitor.
   - Preprocessors: Configure additional processing steps for analyzing traffic.
   - Rule Paths: Specify the paths to rule files, including local.rules.
   ```bash
   # Set the network variables
   var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
   var EXTERNAL_NET any
   
   # Include rule files
   include /etc/snort/rules/local.rules

`local.rules`
The local.rules file contains custom rules for Snort. These rules are designed to detect and block specific types of traffic, such as ICMP flood attacks and access to certain websites.

Example rules:
```bash
   # Set the network variables
   var HOME_NET 192.168.1.0/24
   var EXTERNAL_NET any
   
   # Include rule files
   include /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
```

`alert`
The alert file logs alerts generated by Snort. Each alert contains information about the detected event, including the type of attack, source and destination IP addresses, and timestamps.

### Starting Snort
To start Snort in inline mode with detailed alerts, use the following command:
```bash
   sudo snort -A full -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i enp0s3:enp0s8 -Q
```
   -A full: Sets the alert mode to full, providing detailed alert information.
   -c /etc/snort/snort.conf: Specifies the configuration file Snort should use.
   -i enp0s3:enp0s8: Indicates the network interfaces Snort should monitor.
   -Q: Enables inline mode, allowing Snort to act as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and block malicious traffic.

### Testing and Validation
   1. **Ping Test**:
   - Use the ping command from the attacker VM to send ICMP Echo Request messages to the Snort VM and the target server.
   - Verify that Snort drops the ICMP packets and logs alerts.

   2. **Tracert Test**:
   - Use the tracert command to trace the path of packets to the target server.
   - Ensure packets pass through the Snort VM and are monitored.

   3. **Wireshark Analysis**:
   - Capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.
   - Confirm that ICMP packets and access to blocked websites are being filtered as expected.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Snort in protecting web servers from ICMP-based DDoS attacks and controlling access to specific websites. By configuring Snort with appropriate rules and running it in inline mode, malicious traffic can be detected and blocked, ensuring the availability and security of web services.
